# Terms of Use

Thank you for using Backgammon. Please read this Terms of Use agreement carefully before accessing or using Backgammon.

## Definitions

The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the Backgammon Privacy Policy, available at backgammon.siteless.co/privacy-policy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.

The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Backgammon.

The “Website” refers to Backgammon’s website located at backgammon.siteless.co, and all content, services, and products provided by Backgammon at or through the Website.

“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions.

“Backgammon,” “We,” and “Us” refers to the maintainers of backgammon Backgammon, including contractors and employees.

“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service.

"Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.

An "Account" represents your legal relationship with Backgammon. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on Backgammon.

## Accounts

Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions.

One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).

You must be age 13 or older. Backgammon does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.

Your login may only be used by one person.

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.

You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password.

Backgammon cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

You will promptly notify Backgammon if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

## Acceptable Use

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our Acceptable Use Policies or Community Guidelines.

## User-Generated Content

### Responsibility for User-Generated Content

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### Backgammon May Remove Content

We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Backgammon terms or policies.

### Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Backgammon Users — certain legal permissions.

#### License Grant to Us

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant Backgammon the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.

#### License Grant to Other Users

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly may be viewed by others.

If you create Content to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of Backgammon a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Backgammon Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Backgammon as permitted through Backgammon's functionality. You may grant further rights if you adopt a license. If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Backgammon Users.

### Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted above, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Backgammon the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## Private Content

Some Accounts may have private Content, which allow the User to control access to Content.

Backgammon considers the contents of private Content to be confidential to you. Backgammon will protect private Content from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

Backgammon employees may only access the content of your private Content in the following situations:

-   With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If Backgammon accesses private Content for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge.

-   When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of Backgammon's systems and Service.

#### Exclusions

If we have reason to believe your private Content is in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove it. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose that Content.

### Copyright Infringement

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on Backgammon violates your rights, please contact us. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.

### Payment

If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.

If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, Backgammon will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.

You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.

For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period.
In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for Backgammon.

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay Backgammon any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact Backgammon Support. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

### Cancellation and Termination

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with Backgammon. You can cancel your Account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. We are also able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' retros.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

Backgammon has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. Backgammon reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

### Communications with Backgammon

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

Communications made through email or Backgammon Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to Backgammon or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to Backgammon is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to Backgammon must be in writing and served on Backgammon's legal agent.

Backgammon only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

### Disclaimer of Warranties

Backgammon provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

Backgammon does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

### Limitation of Liability

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
your use or inability to use the Service; any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service; the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available; unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data; statements or conduct of any third party on the Service; any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

### Release and Indemnification

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release Backgammon from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that Backgammon (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases Backgammon of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

### Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price changes, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website. For non-material modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our Site Policy repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.
